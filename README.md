Good morning 2020! A new decade. You are practicing social distancing or being quarantined depending on the forces that govern your country. You are well-aware now of that weird virus spreading accross the globe.
Yet, you still want to learn things, keep your mind entertained. Well, you're at the right place.
Take a look at your window. Sun is shining, isn't it ? Is that a cloud in the horizon ? If only you could see the weather forecast.
No, you can't just use your phone; you should not trust these people. They sell your personal data.
You should build something for yourself. And I think I actually have a nice design for you, made it myself, based on a free template found on uplabs.

Oh, one last thing; As I started with it, we are in 2020. We don't ship anything that hasn't be tested anymore. Well, actually it might be worth starting with that.
